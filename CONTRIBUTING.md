# Contributing to Acorns

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Acorns and its packages, which are hosted in the [Repo](https://github.com/deshanadesai/acorns) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Testing

Please write C++ examples for new code you create in [this directory](https://github.com/deshanadesai/acorns/tree/master/examples/sample_c_functions) and then include the call to the forward and reverse single and double differentiation in [this file](https://github.com/deshanadesai/acorns/blob/master/examples/run_sample_c_functions.py).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to acorns](https://github.com/deshanadesai/acorns/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include examples in the `examples/` directory as described above. We can always use more test coverage. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
    
    
Thank you!!
